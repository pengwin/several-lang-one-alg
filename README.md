- **Time** - Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss) 
- **Memory** - Maximum resident set size (kbytes) 
- **Normal** - Number of calls to DFS function compared to number of graph nodes (calls<=n) 
- **Average** - Number of calls to DFS function compared to number of graph nodes (n< calls <3n) 
- **Bad** - Number of calls to DFS function compared to number of graph nodes (calls > 3n) 
- **Worst** - The worst number of calls to DFS function and number of graph nodes
